# Circaevum "Yellow Paper"

Because it's not quite a public White Paper release, but I want to get the ideas out there and get your input on what else to include in the Whitepaper, how it would be released, etc.

Circaevum - A Temporal World

### This is a technical endeavor.

If we figure out a way to financially support this we will, but for now this is more about the backbone of the system itself. Building an experience entirely around how we internalize big long-term plans. At its heart, this is meant to be an experience for the individual. Helping one get their own mind through the noise, and around the data that's important for everyday life. A familiar place to explore data, create plans in, and pull memories into. From there, this system will serve as a stage for a global conversation. Not sure entirely how that will manifest - it seems it's important to prioritize the space as a grounding place for the individual first and foremost.
