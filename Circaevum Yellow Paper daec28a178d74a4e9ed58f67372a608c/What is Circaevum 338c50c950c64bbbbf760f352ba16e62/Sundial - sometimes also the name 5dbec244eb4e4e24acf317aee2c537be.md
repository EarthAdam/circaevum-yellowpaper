# Sundial - sometimes also the name

"A sundial is a device that tells the time of day when there is sunlight by the apparent position of the Sun in the sky." -Wikipedia

As the future of the web is a collection of virtual spaces collectively known as the Metaverse, the pursuit of Sundial is to operate as a personal utility that can be carried between worlds in the user's inventory. The purpose of this tool is to enable the user to hyper-analyze any accessible dataset from a time-based perspective. Sundial uses a mapping engine to project datasets into a 3D coordinate system based on the timestamps associated with that data or event.

The Sundial is a Device for Immersive Reality

The Sundial stands as a symbol for a point in evolution in which humanity gained the ability to derive and organize information about time, based purely on measuring the position of the Sun in light of our position on Earth.

In a world where our situational awareness is key to our survival, human intelligence has designed techniques to improve our understanding of the world around us. Separately, we have developed a natural skill at managing events in our life with respect to the natural cycles that we are not only subject to, but wholly dependent on. 

As an Earth-based life form, we are intertwined with the natural cycles of day and night, but as we are on the verge of becoming an interplanetary species, our ability to reconcile our cycle-dependent nature will determine our success at life beyond our home.
