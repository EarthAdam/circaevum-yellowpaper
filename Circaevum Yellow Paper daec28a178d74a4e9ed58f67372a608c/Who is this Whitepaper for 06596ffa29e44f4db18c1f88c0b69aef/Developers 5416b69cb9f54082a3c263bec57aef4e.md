# Developers

For developers interested in working on this project, this is/will-be a good place to start. Well, and here ([Architecture Overview](../Architecture%20Overview%20b7deda7bc3de4e24a1d46e292325392b.md)), but this page is to try and describe how to contribute. The goal is to build this into an open-sourced project, although right now there are important components of cybersecurity that need to be pulled out of what goes into the open-sourced code before doing that since this is an app that testers are using, and have their data in. 

The Architecture Overview (above) will be the best place to understand how things are currently built, and then things in **BLUE** are things that are future software/experience features where help is needed (**YELLOW** is for "Whitepaper" related tasks).

Then let's get some discussion on how you can help out with that if you're interested. Just reach out and we can figure it out. GitHub Issues is the home base for the code around updates, and there's a Trello Software Board ([https://trello.com/b/cDtsermi](https://trello.com/b/cDtsermi)) that I might think about making more up-to-date (or letting somebody help manage).

In fact, let's try this blue-colored-things-that-I-need-help-with thing now. Bare with me here. I'm creating a new Trello board just now, to manage the more overhead tasks for the sake of the "Whitepaper" and Alpha Parallel public releases: [https://trello.com/b/izdRIB8h](https://trello.com/b/izdRIB8h)
With the first BLUE item to help with is 

1.1 Help make the Trello Software Board more up-to-date: [https://trello.com/c/hxrptz4E](https://trello.com/c/hxrptz4E)

We can post links to cards in Discord, and link them to GItHub Issues. Let's try to keep it pretty minimal for now though. The more churn we can get going through updates the better. Documentation is only as useful as it serves the product - doesn't help if documentation is great but there is no product, or the product is stale.
