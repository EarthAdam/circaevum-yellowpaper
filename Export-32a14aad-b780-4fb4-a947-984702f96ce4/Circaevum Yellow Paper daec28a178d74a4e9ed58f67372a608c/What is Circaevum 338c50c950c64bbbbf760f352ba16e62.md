# What is Circaevum?

*pronounced: (sir-kay-vum)*

"Circa" + "Aevum"

Inspired by a term ("Aevum") coined in the middle ages to describe the logical state of time experienced uniquely by humans, the name "Circaevum" was created to represent a holistic approach to how we conceive of time, and how we manage it in our minds. A state of consciousness that ties together the parts of our brain that otherwise independently manage Space and Time.

Circaevum is a 3D mapping system for visually organizing and navigating time

Circaevum is the calendar of the metaverse

Circaevum is a memory palace built for the Circadian Rhythm

Circaevum is a logical framework for visually organizing long-term memory

Circaevum is the stage for sharing long-term global visions

Circaevum is a mapping system that is built on-top of three fundamental concepts:

In addition, it is meant to build upon the technologies we have devised to interpret and organize our lives with respect to time. From the Sundial, to Sextants, Geodetics, the Gregorian Calendar, Time Zones, these have evolved to create order for our lives on Earth. As we are on the verge of becoming an interplanetary species, we need to zoom out, and look at the world we live in from a stage that brings the order of the Solar System into our base-level consciousness.
